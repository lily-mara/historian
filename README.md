We are members of Miami University's chapter of the ACM. We are writing this application
as our submission for the [Do Something Awesome](https://github.com/miami-acm/do-something-awesome)
competition put on by Miami's ACM.

Why
---

As software developers, we understand the importance of using Version Control Software.
There are many options to chose from, and they all have a dedicated user base:

- Git (If you're smart)
- Mercurial (If you're a hipster)
- SVN (If you work for old people)
- CVS (If you hate yourself)
- Bazaar (Nobody)

The problem with all of these tools is that they are designed by software developers,
for software developers. This means that almost nobody outside of the industry uses them
due to their steep learning curves. We seek to change that with the Historian project.

What
---

Historian is a simple version control system for people unfamiliar with such systems.
It is a web application that will allow users to edit plain text files and commit them
to Git repositories while abstracting away Git's Torvaldian interface. It will be:

- Web-based
- Allow editing of plain-text files
- Allow diffing between commits
- Allow user to set commit author during commit writing
